This is a simple Tweeter bot developed using Python and Tweepy module.

The bot retweets and favorites tweets based in specified keywords.

## Twitter Bot Challenge (#BuildWhat'sNext)
The Twitter Bot Challenge aims to support the tech ecosystem in Kenya to build using the Twitter API.
We will be using the API to build for fun by creating bots. This is a summary of my experience participating, the good, the bad and the ugly, and most of all what you learned.

The goal is to create a twitter bot which tweets Dev, Linux, and other Coding content. Primarily, I decided to develop the bot using Python as it has several handy libraries and tools. As always, it is safer to code new python projects within virtual environments.


## Requirements
- Twitter developer account
- Python3.8
- Python virtual environment
